# BruinPool Flutter

This is the mobile frontend code repository for BruinPool: made with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).<br>
For additional guidance/help, email justinhan1997@gmail.com or your current Engineering Manager.

## Local Development Setup

1. You will need to install the Flutter SDK, which can be done by following instructions in the [installation docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. You will also need an Android/iOS emulator installed on your computer in order to run the app locally.<br>
   Refer to installation instructions for either [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) or
   [XCode](https://andybargh.com/how-to-install-xcode/).
3. Once your emulator is setup, within the root directory, run the command `flutter run`.<br>
   This should make an app named "BruinPool" appear on your emulator. The app should automatically be initiated.
4. Once your app is running, open the codebase with an IDE (i.e. VS Code, Sublime Text), and then get coding! :)

## Flutter Dev Tips

1. If `flutter run` returns an error, try `flutter devices` to return list of connected devices recognized by Flutter.
2. Run `flutter doctor` to check for any missing dependencies either for Flutter or Android Studio/XCode.
3. Flutter supports [hot reloading](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/hot-reload), so once app starts running,
   press `r` in the terminal to apply live changes you have made, or `R` to reload entire application.
